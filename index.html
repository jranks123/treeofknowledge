        The Story of Creation
      </h1>

      <h2 class="subtitle">
        Tree of Knowledge
      </h1>

      <p>
        In the beginning… a neuron fired, spreading the seed of an idea,
        riding high on a wave of electrical signals to propagate in the
        fertile mind of an earthling, something magical that had never
        been thought into fruition before.
      </p>
      <p class="bold-font">
        Behold!
      </p>
      <p>
        The vision of a beautiful tree began to sprout, rising out
        of the Tankwa dust - a symbol of Creation itself.
      </p>
      <p class="bold-font">
        Let’s make manifest!
      </p>
      <p>
        For Creation is the process of bringing that ethereal
        spark into material existence. And because many hands
        make light work - you’re needed!
      </p>
      <p>
        Come join in the creation, add your energy to the Tree
        of Knowledge, make your own mark & help create a work
        of art that is more than mere fancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        When your work is done, search amongst its leafy
        heights to find the key to our humanness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meet the smooth tongued serpent suspended,
        whispering sibilant secrets to those who care to
        listen.
      </p>
      <p class="bold-font">
        Eat of the fruit - if you dare!
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose day, choose night. You decide.
      </p>
      <p>
        For amongst it’s leafy bower, you choose to
        live or you choose to die.
      </p>

      <p>
        Choose to dance, to fly, to breathe, to know,
        or to deny.
      </p>

      <p>
        Join us there, because here all the answers
        lie.
